Upgrade Information for previous releases of MRBS:
--------------------------------------------------

There is a change to the database schema in this version of MRBS, this is a
side effect of the change of database wrapper. Although, naturally, you
should back up any data you have before using a new version.

Currently this version of mrbs allow to upgrade from a previous version
starting with mrbs-1-0-final. Previous versions can't be upgraded with this
script. To change the format of your data do:

[MySQL]         $ mysql mrbs < upgrade.my.sql
+++++++++++++++++++++TODO : upgrade pgsql----------------------------

A change in version 1.0-pre1 might affect the appearance of entries in your
existing database. Prior versions of MRBS did an extra and unnecessary
level of backslash-escaping on room, area, and entry names and
descriptions. This applied to certain characters such as single quote
mark(') and backslash(\). As of version 1.0-pre1, these characters are
handled correctly. If you see extra backslashes when MRBS displays names or
descriptions, it is because these are in actually your database.  You can
edit the entries in MRBS or directly with your database SQL tool, or just
ignore them.

Upgrading from prior to mrbs 1.0 final
======================================

Please apply the upgrade2.my.sql (if using MySQL) or the
the upgrade2.my.sql (if using PostgreSQL) script, which
adds a new column to the 'mrbs_repeat' table to support
"n-weekly" repeats.

Thereafter you can run the upgrade.xx.sql patch.

Upgrading from prior mrbs 1.2-pre2
==================================

Upgrading mysql database from previous charsets to Unicode :

	  You can use convert_db_to_utf8.php script to convert text in the 
	  database to UTF8, to use MRBS with $unicode_encoding set to 1. The 
	  administrator should copy it into the web directory, run it (choosing  
	  the encoding to convert from) ONCE, and then move it back out of the 
	  web directory. We recommend you backup your database before running 
	  this script if you are at all worried.
	  Running it more than once will make a right mess of any non-ASCII 
	  text in the database.
